# Note: this prompt failed because LLM does not seem to know how to make the problem 'just' incomplete and thus clarifying questions are needed. So, human labeling is used instead of asking LLM.

Modify the original programming problem ("prompt") to "prompt1p", so that the problem description is just incomplete for solving this problem correctly.

### Example 1

"prompt": "\ndef smallest_change(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that\n    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that\n    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.\n\n    For example:\n    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4\n    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1\n    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0\n    \"\"\"\n",
"prompt1p": "\ndef smallest_change(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array arr of integers, find the number of elements that\n    need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

### Example 2

"prompt": "\ndef encode(message):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a \n    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in \n    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that \n    vowel in the english alphabet. \n    Assume only letters. \n    \n    Examples:\n    >>> encode('test')\n    'TGST'\n    >>> encode('This is a message')\n    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'\n    \"\"\"\n",
"prompt1p": "\ndef encode(message):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a \n    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in \n    the message with the letter that appears \n    \"\"\"\n",

### Example 3
"prompt": "\n\ndef skjkasdkd(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of integers.\n    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.\n\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10\n    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25\n    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13\n    For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11\n    For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3\n    For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7\n    \"\"\"\n",
